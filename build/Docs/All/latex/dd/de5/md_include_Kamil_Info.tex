I want to make a light Text \mbox{\hyperlink{classEditor}{Editor}} similar in style to vim/neovim. It enables you to edit, save, load and manipulate text in a custom UI built using SFML and cpp.\+It should be mouse and keyboard friendly and be able to run commands from a command line similar to other vim-\/like editors\hypertarget{md_include_Kamil_Info_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{md_include_Kamil_Info_autotoc_md1}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Editor:
    - Zoom in / Out
    - Scroll up and down
    - change background colour
    - change text colour
    - (potentially) load default colourScheme

KeyBoard:
    - Handle commands such as cmd + s to save etc
    - Use arrorw keys and H,J,K,L to move through the text
Mouse:
    - Use mouse position to place cursor in text
    - select text using mouse

Files:
    - Save files
    - Load files
    - create directory tree
    - traverse directory 
    - handled in .txt format
