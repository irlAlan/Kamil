\begin{DoxyVerb}As programmers we spend most of our time writing, reading and editing code most of us use  IDE's (Integrated Development Environments)
which are built to contain everything we need for a successful program. The downside of IDE's however, is the fact that they are large
behemoths of applications and are often very slow to load as well as very restrictive on the devices/Os you can run it on.

On the other hand we have true CHADS in the programming world who use smaller Text Editors whoes only ability is to edit code
these CHADS are the true 10x developers who optimise everything they interact with and use fast editors like vim/neovim and notepad
(and fast small IDE's like Emacs)

These editors come with their own issues though
