The Project I will be developing will be in answer to the challenge set out by the end user and friend of mine, Kamil. He challenged me to make a light weight editor that he can use in his day to day life and when doing python projects.

This leads me on to identifying the base problems at hand and summing them into 3 questions\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}1) What is a text editor and how does it differ from an IDE?
2) How do I make a text editor or IDE for kamil
3) How do I make it efficient enough to meet his standards?
\end{DoxyVerb}
 To kick things along I began to do research on Text editors and IDE\textquotesingle{}s and found out that the difference between isnt limited to Operating System platforms or by how much better one is at a specific task but by the features each can do. Text Editors, as the name suggest are specifically desinged for manipulting any form of text that it can open. While an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is specifically desinged for software development and comes with a multitude of features that engineers can make use of to streemline their workflow.

When talking to Kamil about his needs it was apparant that he wanted something modular in the sense that it comes with what he needs so its not a hassle to work with and it works with multiple different file types.
