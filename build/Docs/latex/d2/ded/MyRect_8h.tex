\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Interface file for the \mbox{\hyperlink{classMyRect}{My\+Rect}} class. 

Inherits from sf\+::\+Float\+Rect and sf\+::\+Drawable. sf\+::\+Float\+Rect is a templated class of sf\+::\+Rect$<$float$>$ and its primary use is for defining the border and creating a hollow rectangle, as such it only has methods for collision detection and intersections. The normal Rectangle\+Shape class creates a basic rectangle without the collision and intersections checking so we inherit this functionality from Float\+Rect and in effect add it to the instantiated Rectangle\+Shape in the \mbox{\hyperlink{classMyRect}{My\+Rect}} class.

The sf\+::\+Drawable is only here to add a draw property to our class so when we draw to the Render\+Target, in this case Render\+Window, we can use the same code of window.\+draw(our\+\_\+own\+\_\+object) instead of the general our\+\_\+own\+\_\+object.\+draw(window). This is done so when others use this code it makes it easier for them to follow a standard way of drawing to the Render\+Target and not having to worry about passing parameters into the objects.
