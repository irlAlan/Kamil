## Evaluation

To conclude, the program I have made is decent. It is still lacking in many areas and is still very ameaturish, but it has all the main objectives
that we were looking for initially.

The program is very fast and effiecient with sub millisecond speed.



Improvements that we could have made to the already exsisting code could be to link SFML with Opengl and use them together not just a stand alone SFML library.
This should be changed next time becuase SFML by itself is certainly powerful but for something more general and not game oriented it can be limiting on certain features
that can only be changed by either messing with the SFML code so it works or by bringing opengl into it and expanding on the current functionality. The
limiting features where Text handling, specifically for this project the colouring of text.
